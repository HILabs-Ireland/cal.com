The easiest way to get started with Cal.com is on our website. We offer a generous free tier where you get unlimited scheduling with no limits and all of our features built for individuals, with a teams plan for collaboration features.

[Sign up here](https://cal.com/signup) to create your free account.

Most people will do this, but for full data ownership and control over your scheduling, you can [self-host Cal.com](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.

To get started, head to [cal.com/signup](https://cal.com/signup), where you'll be able to enter your desired username (the part that comes after cal.com, like cal.com/bailey), your email and a password. Alternatively, you can sign up using your Google account, or using SAML SSO by clicking on the respective buttons.

Once you've signed up, you'll go through the new user onboarding flow. Click below to skip to that section of the documentation.
